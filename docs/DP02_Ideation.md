# Design Project 2: Ideation

**Albaka**: Dayeon Kim, Sujin Jang, Heeju Wi, Hyunjoo Paik


## 1. Point Of View
User: **Part-timers in periodical schedule changing and role-distributed workplace**

Needs: To **communicate scheduling information** immediately and clearly with other part-timers 

Reason: Each part-timer cannot get direct updates on their timetable, enough information about others’ schedule, and rational process of the replacement.


> In the **periodical schedule changing workplace**, part-time schedules are changing every week or month, so part-timers must submit their available times for each allocation process and keep in mind that their new assigned schedules may differ from their previous schedules.
>
> In the **role-distributed workplace**, part-timers have their own role. At least one part-timer is required for each role every hour, so the schedule is assigned considering the role of each part-timer.

## 2. Persona

- She was not assigned her submitted time enough because many other part-timers who have same roles with her applied to same time.
- She mistook her schedule because her work time changes per week, so she went to work at the wrong time.

### Selection Criteria
* Is it the most appropriate question for our POV?
* Is it a feasible question?
* How relevant is the question to our persona’s motivation?
* Does the question correspond to the main process of scheduling?




## 4. Solution Ideas


### Question 1. HMW make the user feel satisfied with the assigned timetable?
"make scheduling process and timetable can better reflect the user's taste and opinions?"

1. **show the competition rate (number of other applicants) on the time slot when submitting the available time**
3. show the role of other applicants on the time slot when submitting the available time
4. show the skill level of other applicants on the time slot when submitting the available time
5. highlight the time slot if the user's role is empty when submitting the available time
6. prevent little time gap between multiple work hours of the same day
7. allocate the user as many time as he submitted
8. the user can provide feedback on the assigned timetable
9. the user can submit the preferred and disliked workmates
10. the user can submit maximum and minimum work time per day
11. the user can submit preferences for each time slot (preferred / not preferred but available)
12. Can transfer time table to google calendar so the manage time more efficiently


### Question 2. HMW not bother the user when checking schedule?

1. **emphasize one’s timetable visually**
1. two separate modes of the timetable (everyone’s timetable / my timetable)
1. a filter that shows only the schedule of one’s working days
1. attendance point when the user checks the schedule
1. the user can change the layout of information according to his importance
1. download button of timetable image
1. send one’s timetable to phone easily
1. send one’s timetable automatically if updated without visiting the web page
1. notify if the schedule related with the user is changed
1. notify right before working time
1. match timeslot of the timetable with time axis easily

### Question 3. HMW find the other user to take one’s place simply?

1. **list of available users at a specific time**
1. direct contact system to users in the list at once
1. the user can answer the replacement request only by YES/NO
1. bulletin board which contains replacement information only
1. view the status of the replacement (recruiting / contacting / completed)
1. graphical statistics about the ratio of acceptance to the request of replacements
1. make messages about replacement by only using the mouse
1. notify user immediately when a replacement request is sent to him
1. get into the replacement page just by clicking the notification
1. inform the recruiting replacement visually on the timetable

### Selection Criteria

* Is it the most appropriate solution to our HMWs?
* Is it a feasible solution?
* Is it relevant to the persona’s motivation?
* Is it correspond to the main feature of scheduling issue?


### Top 3 Solution Ideas

1. show the competition rate (number of other applicants) on the time slot when submitting the available time
    * It is related to the second frustrating experience of the persona. 
    * If we make some kind of online scheduling platform, a computation of competition rates of each time could be done immediately.(feasible)

2. emphasize one’s timetable visually
    * According to the persona(Suji)'s experience, she mistook her schedule and went to work at the wrong time. 
    * The one way to emphasize is that to treat other people's time as achromatic and put color only in one's time.(feasible)

3. provide the list of available users at a specific time on the replacement process
    * If we save the submitted available time, we can provide a list based on it.(feasible)



## 5. Storyboards
1. The user can view the competition rate on that time slot when submitting the available time.

2. The user can check their timetable at once if one's timetable is distinguished visibly from others.

3. (on replacement process) The user can see the list of available users at a specific time

## 6. Studio Reflections

1. Sunday Siesta/ Assem Zhunis:  I wish to know what is special about online reports, I just felt it is a bit obvious.
    -> Currently there is no online submitting system and part-timers have to submit their available time by offline.

2. Out of Stock / Taehyung Kim: I wish there are some motivations for part-timers who replaces the one not available.
    -> Money or commitment to a job could be the motivation of replacement. We will consider this feedback and suggest some idea for motivations in the next DP. 

3. Sunday Siesta/Aitolkyn Baigutanova: I wish you explained how can we distinguish between different schedules (a point about visualizing schedules) 
    -> We are considering several ways and the one is that to treat other people's time as achromatic and put color only in their own time.

4. She likes highlighted solutions

5. Need more specified user
    -> We changed our target user to "Part-timers in periodically schedule changing workplace" from "weekly scheduled part-timer".
