# Design Project 1: Needfinding

**Redesign the Scheduling and Communication System in Weekly-Scheduled Part-Time Job**

**Team 100**: Dayeon Kim, Sujin Jang, Heeju Wi, Hyunjoo Paik


## 1. Experience

* Redesign users’ experience of “Scheduling and Communication System in the Weekly-Scheduled Part-Time Job"
* Main targets are the part-timers who work in the weekly-scheduled system


## 2. Observation & Interviews

### Interviewees

* We interviewed various part-timers with different levels of skill. 
* We wanted to know what kind of difficulty and inconvenience they suffer from the original scheduling and communication system.
* Extreme users are the **novice** who is not yet adapted to the system and the **experts** who have worked for more than five years and are familiar with the system.

### Interesting Moments

1) **Bikini** wants to separate his available time and preferred time. Because at some time, he can work if there is no one to work but doesn't want to.

2) **Tube** said there are things he can't talk easily.
    - When the next person shows up late he wants to express the displeasure. But he thinks if he tells publicly, it'll make relationship uncomfortable.


3) **Tube** said part-timers in swimming pool use one kakao group chat.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/iNgvXZK.jpg =300x)
    - He wanted to find someone to replace him.
    - Part-timers in swimming pool check their attendance on their kakao group chat because it is the only way to communicate with all part-timers.


4) **Pig** said kakao group chat itself is not an efficient way to get information that he needs.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/G5K05FE.png =400x)
    - He uses a shortcut to get into kakao group chat fast.
    - He turns off notifications not to be bothered as there are so many conversations which are not related to him. However, to get the information which he is interested in fast, he uses keyword notification for 'replacement' and 'seeking'


5) **Sponge Bob** complained about the notification system of Lotteria
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/AbAwYMq.jpg =400x)
    - If there is a message (such as corn salad is sold out) to deliver to the part-timer at the next turn and next-next turn, Post-it is the only way. Because they do not know who is working next and also they do not have their phone number. But post-it is not reliable.


6) **Sponge Bob** failed to find someone to replace her.
    - Lotteria does not recommend using kakao group chat to find a someone to work instead of her. So She had to contact all close part-timers until She found one. As this process is super slow, she often failed to find one to take her place on time.
    
    
7) It was harsh for **Patric star** to work in the group without a balance between workers
![](https://i.imgur.com/KutPpOj.jpg =400x)

    - There must be one who is skilled to see through an affair and prepare food before it runs out. Without the balance between part-timers delay occurs.


8) **Cake** said he is not used to using his radio which is to communicate with other part-timers.
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/dVA1Qqj.jpg =400x)
    - So when he wants to communicate with others, he just talks directly or asks others to deliver his words.

    - Because it was hard to find a novice user who has just started working as a part-timer, and 'Cake', who started his work just 2 weeks before, was in Seoul, so we interviewed him with a video call.
    


## 3. Needs



**Scheduling Needs**

1. **Part-timers need to check one's own time table quickly**.
2. Part-timers need to separate their available time and preferred time.
3. Part-timers need to find a person to replace without unnecessary processes.
4. **Part-timers need to check one's current wage and working hour**.

**Communication Needs**

5. **Part-timers need to distribute roles explicitly**.
6. Part-timers need to send a message to manager anonymously.
7. Part-timers need to contact to other part-timers easily even if they are not close.
8. **Part-timers need to give notice to the part-timers working at a specific time or session, not to a specific person.**
9. Part-timers need to get a notice immediately and clearly even if they turn off the notification of kakao group chat.
10. Part-timers need to get a notification for interesting information such as finding a person to replace.
11. Part-timers need the way to use a device of communicating with other part-timers easily.

## 4. Insights

1. **The scheduled time should not bother workers.**
    - If the workers are scheduled only 30 minutes or even an hour, the workers do not want to work for that time because its cost of going to work site takes more than earning.
    
2. When they submit their available time for their weekly time schedule, they want to submit two time slot: the time they prefer and the time they don't prefer but available.
     
3. **Information about other part-timers matters in specific cases.**
    - Other part-timers who work with is also a very important issue in the case of Lotteria. If there isn't enough skilled person when it's busy food often runs out and delay happens.
    
4. Part-timers’ roles are not distributed explicitly.
    - All of the interviewees said they get the information of what to do after they arrive over to their workplace.

5. The workers want to get their scheduled time fast.
    - After the workers submitted their available time slot, they get their scheduled time after 2-3 days. So they want to get the time table fast to manage their time.

6. **The change in the time table should be shown immediately.**
    -   If there were changes on the time table, because of the replacement of others or other events, they want to know it immediately.

7. **There isn’t enough information for both part-timers who seek someone to replace.**
    - When the worker who cannot work for his scheduled time seeks someone to replace him, he has to contact all the candidates.

8. There is no way to inform that the specific part-timer wants to work more.
    - If a worker wants to work more than his scheduled time, he has to ask every other worker whether you mind giving your scheduled time.

9. **There are lots of notices for part-timers regardless of their work time or role through kakao group chat.**
    - Our target users communicate only within their one kakao group chat, so all of the information which is not related to their role, work-time is transmitted to them.

10. The essential or preferred information for each worker has to be emphasized. 
    - Because target users communicate within their kakao group talk, the information they think essential disappears from their view easily when the other information comes.

11. The essential or preferred information for each worker has to notice them immediately.
    - In the current system, some important information can be ignored. Also, interesting information for a specific user which is not using the keyword cannot notify the user. 
    
12. **No opportunity to express dissatisfaction with other workers or system.**
    - Our target user wanted to nag or criticize someone about their work quality. But it is hard to say face-to-face or even direct message with their names.


## 5. Studio Reflections


-  The presentation is well constructed, slides look clean, informative and properly spaced. Images shown also help in understanding. Interviewing various groups give a broader understanding of issues faced by part-timers.

- Narrow down target users as one single class among manager and part-timer.
    -> We made a target user as a part-timer only.
- Focus on "Why".
    -> We modified and updated Interesting Moment, Needs, and Insights as your comments. We focused on why did users go through such interesting moments. 

- How about interview other places that have already a good scheduling strategy.
    -> Okay, we will try to find somewhere else with good scheduling strategy.

- Swimming Pool and Lotteria(fast food restaurant) might have quite different characteristics in the part-time system. 
    -> We agree with it. However, in this project for needfinding, we mainly focused on the scheduling and communication issue. We will consider the difference and the common feature between several weekly-scheduled workspaces, and then reflect it next time.
